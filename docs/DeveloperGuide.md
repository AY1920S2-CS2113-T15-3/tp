## 2.3 Verifying the setup
1. Run Module Manager to verify and try a few commands. Do refer to the user guide for a list of commands to try out.
2. Run the JUnit Tests/gradlew test command to ensure that all test case passes.

## 2.4 Configurations to do before writing code
**Configuring the coding style**
* Module Manager uses CheckStyle to check for code quality violations.
* To configure your project to use CheckStyle, add `id 'checkstyle'` under plugins for your `build.gradle` file.
* Ensure that your CheckStyle toolVersion is 8.23 by adding `toolVersion = '8.23'` into your `build.gradle` file.
Refer to Module Manager's `build.gradlew` file as a reference to set up CheckStyle correctly.

**Getting started with coding**
When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get a sense of the overall design by reading about 
Module Manager's architecture in the next section.

# 3. Design
This section provides a high level overview of our application, Module Manager.
## Design & Implementation


### 3.1 Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/DeetoMok/tp/raw/master/docs/images/Architecture.png)

The Architecture Diagram given above explains the high-level design of the Module Manager Application.

Module Manager consists of a main class called Duke responsible for
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary

The other components involved are:

`UI`: The user interface of the application

`Parser`: This class mainly handles the parsing and handling of user commands

`Command`: This class handles the type of command

`Person`: This class manages the data of the user in memory

`Controller`: This class determines what to do with the parsed input of the user 

`Storage`: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk


#### 3.2 UI component
![Ui Diagram](https://github.com/DeetoMok/tp/raw/master/docs/images/Ui.png)

The `UI` component consists of a `Ui` class that stores all user interaction output data. 
It displays all user interactions to the user based on the command line inputs received.

The `UI` component,

*   Executes user commands using the `Logic` component

#### 3.3 Logic component

![Object Diagram of Logic Component](https://github.com/DeetoMok/tp/raw/master/docs/images/Object_Diagram_of_Logic_Component.png)

The `Logic` component 
1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. The parsed command is passed to `Controller` which then returns a specific command class 
e.g. `AddCommand`, `FindCommand` etc. which is executed by the main class `Duke`.
All these command classes inherits from the abstract `Command` class.
3. The command execution can affect the Model (e.g. adding a module in ModuleList)
4. The result of the command execution is passed back to the Ui.
5. In addition, the command execution can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, 
such as displaying help to the user.

#### 3.4 Model component

![Class Diagram of Model Component](https://github.com/DeetoMok/tp/raw/master/docs/images/Class_Diagram_of_Model_Component.png)

The `Model` component is responsible for serving as a boundary between the `Controller` component and `Storage` 
component. 

The responsibilities of the `Model` component includes
* Storing the data in-memory during programme runtime. It stores all `SelectedModule` objects in an 
`ArrayList<SelectedModule>` in a `SemModulesList` class. This represents a semester of the user's module plan.
* All `ArrayList<SelectedModule>` is then stored in a `PriorityQueue<SemModulesList>` which contains `SemModulesList`
in an ordered fashion. This class is called `SemesterList`, which represents the entire module plan of the user.


#### 3.5 Storage component


The `Storage` component,
* can save `personInfo` objects in csv format and read it back
* can save the available module list in csv format and read it back
* can save the semester list in csv format and read it back 


### 4. Implementation
This section describes some details on how the features are being implemented. 
All features can be broken down into 4 distinct functionalities - addition, deletion, marking and searching.


#### `Add to Semester` feature 
The `Add to Semester` mechanism is facilitated by `AddtoSemCommand` which extends from an abstract class `Command`. 
It allows `ModuleManager` to assign a module to a semester by adding the module to a 
`SemModulesList`. 

Definition:

`SemModuleList` - An array list of `Module` objects, used to contain modules allocated to a specific semester. 
Signifies a semester in the user's module plan.

`SemesterList` - A priority queue of `SemModuleList`, used to contain `semModuleList` in an sorted order. 
Signifies all semesters of the user's module plan.  

This feature implements the following operations:
Given below is an example how the `Add to Semester` behaves at each step.

##### Step 1:
The user launches the application for the first time. The `SemesterList` will initialize an empty 
`SemModulesList`.

##### Step 2:
When users enter an add to semester command, e.g `add id/CS2113 s/4 mc/4`, the command will be parsed in `Parser`
which will return an `AddToSemCommand`. `AddToSemCommand` then calls `Command#execute(SemesterList semesterList,
 AvailableModulesList availableModulesList) `
`(AddToSemCommand#execute(SemesterList semesterList, AvailableModulesList availableModulesList))`

##### Step 3:
`AddToSemCommand#execute()` then calls self method `AddToSemCommand#addModule()` which calls 
`AddToSemCommand#checkModuleExist(semesterList)` to check whether the selected module is already in the 
user's module plan (i.e:`semesterList`). 
If the module is not in the list, `AddToSemCommand#addModule()` will check whether there is a semester list
(i.e:`semesterModulesList`) whose name is equal to the module's semester name. 
If the semester list exists, the module will be added to the list. 
If not, `AddToSemCommand#addModule()` will create a new semester list and then add this module to the new list. 
Finally, this new semester list will be added to `semesterList`.

#### Step 4:
`AddToSemCommand#execute()` calls `Ui.showAddedToSemMessage(selectedModule.announceAdded())` to tell the user that the
command has been executed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `Add to Semester` operation works:
![Sequence Diagram of Add to Semester](https://github.com/RenzoTsai/tp/blob/Update_DG/docs/UML%20img%20folder/Sequence%20Diagram%20of%20Add%20to%20Semester.png)


#### Calculate CAP feature

The Calculate CAP mechanism is executed by `CalculateCapCommand`.  
`CalculateCapCommand` is extended from `Command` and this implementation calculates the CAP using completed 
`SelectedModule` stored in `SemModulesList`.

Given below is the behaviour of the Calculate CAP mechanism at each step:

Step 1: 
User launches the application. `SelectedModules` are added to `SemModuleList` through either of the following methods:
1) Imported from `semesterList.csv` using `StorageSemesterList.load()`
2) Added using `add id/ID s/SEMESTER mc/MODULE_CREDIT` command

Step 2:
User executes `CAP` command to view his own CAP. The `CAP` commands is parsed through `Parser`, which would then return 
`CalculateCapCommand()`. `CalculateCapCommand.execute()` is then called.

Step 3:
`CalculateCapCommand.execute()` will call `CalculateCapCommand.calculateCap(SemesterList semesterList)`, which will
calculate CAP by looking for all the completed `SelectedModules` stored within `SemModuleList`, which are stored within 
`SemesterList`. It will then assign a `double` type ranging from 0.00 to 5.00 to `Person.totalCap`.

Step 4:
After the CAP is assigned to `Person.totalCap`, `Person.totalCap` is then called and formatted using `DecimalFormat` 
into a `String`
with a pattern of `#.00`. `Ui.showcap(cap)` is called to display the user's cap using the formatted `String`.

The following diagram shows how the Calculate CAP operation works:

`Delete from Semester` feature

The `Delete from Semester` mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteFromSemCommand`, which extends extends from `AddCommand`.
It allows  `ModuleManager` to delete a module from a `SemModulesList`.
By doing so, the following operations are carried out:

##### Step 1:
When a user enters a delete from semester command, e.g `delete id/IS4241 s/4`, this command is being parsed in `Parser`.
`Parser` then returns a `DeleteFromSemCommand`, which calls 
`Command.execute(SemesterList semesterList, AvailableModulesList availableModulesList)`, in this context,
`DeleteFromSemCommand.execute(SemesterList semesterList, AvailableModulesList availableModulesList)`.

##### Step 2:
`DeleteFromSemCommand.execute` then calls its own method `checkModuleExistInCorrectSem(selectedModulesList)`.
`checkModuleExistInCorrectSem(selectedModulesList)` returns a boolean value regarding whether there is such 
a module in the semester stated by the user.
If the module does not exist in that semester, a `RuntimeException` is thrown.
Otherwise, it will run through the `semModulesList` in the `selectedModulesList` to find the semester indicated.
It then calls a method of `SemModulesList`, `getModule(moduleIdentifier)`, which returns the corresponding module,
based on either the `moduleId` or `moduleName`.
Following, it then calls another method of `SemModulesList`, `remove(module)`, which removes the corresponding module.

##### Step 3:
`DeleteFromSemCommand.execute` finally calls `Ui.showDeleteFromSemMessage(String.format(
"Module %s has been deleted from semester %s", moduleIdentifier, yearSemester));`
This tells the user the module that has been deleted from the corresponding semester.

The sequence diagram below shows the mechanics of `DeleteFromSemCommand`:
